# Working with object detection using Tesorflow and keras with DNN
## DNN:
1. DNN is also called convolutional networks, are composed of **multiple levels** of nonlinear operations
2. Here I used cifar 10 dataset for object detection and I cretated Convolutional Neural Network having multiple layers.
3. And I train the cifar model 
4.
